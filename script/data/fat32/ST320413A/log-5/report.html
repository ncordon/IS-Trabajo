<P>
This report plots the iostat output contained in file: 
./data/fat32/ST320413A/log-5.out. The devices analyzed are: 
<UL> 
   <LI>sdb 
</UL> 
For each devices there are a series of plots of the output 
from iostat that was captured. The report is contained in a
subdirectory HTML_REPORT. In that directory you will find a 
file name report.html. Just open that file in a browser 
and you will see the plots. Please note that all plots are 
referenced to the beginning time of the iostat run. 
</P>
 
<P> 
IOstat outputs a number of basic system parameters when it 
creates the output. These parameters are listed below. 
<UL> 
   <LI>System Name: equipo-pc 
   <LI>OS: Linux 
   <LI>Kernel: 3.13.0-48-generic 
   <LI>Number of Cores 1 
   <LI>Core Type _i686_ 
</UL> 
The iostat run was started on 05/01/2015 at 
04:52:14.

1. <a id="cpu_utilization0">Percentage CPU Time (CPU Utilization)</a>. Device: sdb 
</H4> 
 
<P> 
This figure plots three types of CPU Utilization: (1) User, 
(2) System, and (3) Nice. The User utilization is the  percentage 
of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level 
(applications).The System utilization is the percentage of CPU 
utilization that occurred while executing at the system level 
(kernel). The third time is the Nice utilization which is the 
percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at 
the  user  level with nice priority.
